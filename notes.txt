As a user, I want to be able to clear all operations and start from 0.



constants ? complex data [] {}
variables
    TBD
    num1 = Number(button txt)
    num2 = Number(button txt)
    operator - 
    result

DOM Elements - 
    buttons
       div.number
        div.operator
        div.equals
    results - display

event handler  -
    click handler for each group of elements


const numberBtnEls = document.queryuSelectorAll('.number')
const operatorBtnEls = document.queryuSelectorAll('.operator')
const equalBtnEls = document.queryuSelector('.equals')
const displayEl =  document.querySelector('.display')

numberBtnEls.forEach((numberBtnEls) => {
    numberBtnEl.addEventListener('click', UpdateNumbers)
})
const updateResult = () => {
    result = num1
    render()   
}


const render = () => {
    display.textContent = result
}

const UpdateNumbers = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.textContent)
    if(!num1) {
        num1 = evennt.target.textContent
    }
    num1 += event.target.textContent
    updateResult()
}

check what the status of operator is
if it is undefined update num1 if defined update num2

iterater over all operators
assign listener (updateOperator)
